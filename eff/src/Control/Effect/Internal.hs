-- Note [The Eff Machine]
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
The Eff monad is best thought of as a “embedded virtual machine.” Given
primitive support for continuation manipulation from the host, Eff efficiently
implements a complement of complex control operations.

At any time, the Eff machine conceptually manages two pieces of state:

  1. The /metacontinuation stack/, which holds metacontinuation frames.
     Metacontinuation frames correspond to things like effect handlers,
     “thread-local” state, and dynamic winders.

  2. The /targets vector/, which maps a list of effects to the corresponding
     metacontinuation frames that handle them. (See Note [The targets vector].)

However, the representation of the metacontinuation stack is not explicit: it is
implicitly encoded as stack frames on the ordinary GHC RTS stack that cooperate
using a particular calling convention.

Note [Manual worker/wrapper]
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
GHC performs an optimization called the /worker-wrapper transformation/, which
is used to propagate strictness information, unboxing, and more. The idea is
simple: if a function strictly operates on a boxed value, like

    f :: Int -> Foo
    f !n = ...

then GHC will internally rewrite it into a pair of definitions, a /worker/ and a
/wrapper/:

    $wf :: Int# -> Foo
    $wf n = ...

    f :: Int -> Foo
    f (I# n) = $wf n
    {-# INLINE f #-}

If some other code uses f, the wrapper will be inlined at the call site, and the
exposed unfolding allows GHC to make a direct call to $wf passing an unboxed
Int#.

This is great, but the automatic transformation can only do so much. The
worker/wrapper transformation relies on inlining, so it only works for known
calls. This means it can be advantageous to /manually/ perform this kind of
transformation to ensure unboxing happens, especially on datatypes (where the
“worker” is the datatype definition itself and the “wrapper” is a pattern
synonym.) -}

-- | All @eff@ computations operate in the 'Eff' monad. 'Eff' computations are
-- parameterized by a type-level list that specifies which effects they are
-- allowed to perform. For example, a computation of type
-- @'Eff' '['Control.Effect.Error' e, 'Control.Effect.Reader' r, 'Control.Effect.State' s] a@
-- can raise exceptions of type @e@, can access a global environment of type
-- @r@, and can read and modify a single cell of mutable state of type @s@.
--
-- To run an 'Eff' computation that performs effects, the effects must be
-- explicitly /handled/. Functions that handle effects are called
-- /effect handlers/, and they usually have types like the following:
--
-- @
-- runX :: 'Eff' (X ': effs) a -> 'Eff' effs a
-- @
--
-- Note that the argument to @runX@ can perform the @X@ effect, but the result
-- cannot! Any @X@ operations have been handled by @runX@, which interprets
-- their meaning. Examples of effect handlers include
-- 'Control.Effect.Error.runError', 'Control.Effect.Reader.runReader', and
-- 'Control.Effect.State.Strict.runState'.
--
-- After all effects have been handled, the resulting computation will have type
-- @'Eff' '[] a@, a computation that performs no effects. A computation with
-- this type is pure, so it can be converted to an ordinary value using 'run'.
--
-- Some effects cannot be handled locally, but instead require performing I/O.
-- These effects will delegate to the 'IOE' effect, which provides low-level
-- interop with Haskell’s built-in 'IO' monad. After all other effects have been
-- handled, a computation of type @'Eff' '['IOE'] a@ can be converted to an
-- ordinary @'IO' a@ computation using 'runIO'.

-- Note [The targets vector]
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
In most implementations of delimited control or algebraic effects, handling an
effect involves walking the prompt/handler stack looking for a frame with the
right tag. This is a little unfortunate, as in the large majority of use cases,
the handler stack changes infrequently relative to the number of effectful
operations that are performed. Therefore, we take a slightly different approach,
and we cache which effects are handled by which handlers at any given time.

This cache is stored in the /targets vector/ (represented by type `Targets`), an
immutable SmallArray that contains pointers to `Handler`s. Each effect is mapped
to a handler using its index in the type-level list. For example, if we have a
computation of type

    Eff '[Reader Int, NonDet, Error String] a

then the targets vector will be three elements long. Index 0 will point to a
handler for `Reader Int`, index 1 will point to a handler for `NonDet`, and
index 2 will point to a handler for `Error String`.

The targets vector makes `send` a constant-time operation, regardless of the
number of effects. The `:<` class provides the effect’s index, so `send` need
only look up the index in the targets vector and invoke the handler. This is a
particularly good tradeoff in situations where the following conditions hold:

  1. Most effects are handled at the top-level of the program and changed
     infrequently during runtime.

  2. Most calls to `send` do not need to capture the continuation.

In practice, these conditions seem usually true. However, if they aren’t,
maintaining the targets vector has a cost: it needs to be recomputed on every
use of `handle` or `lift`, and continuation restore requires recomputing the
vector for every `handle` or `lift` frame in the captured continuation! In most
cases, the vector is very small, so this isn’t a big deal.

If the overhead of maintaining the targets vector ever turns out to be
significant, there are a variety of potential optimizations that we currently
don’t do. Here are a couple possibilities:

  * Most continuations are restored in the same context where they’re captured,
    so there’s no need to recompute the targets vectors upon restore. Skipping
    is the recomputation in that case is likely a particularly easy win.

  * If the list of effects grows very large, the cost of copying the whole
    vector could become prohibitive. In those situations, we could switch to a
    more sophisticated representation that allows more sharing while still
    providing decent access time, avoiding the need for unbounded copying. -}

{- Note [Explicitly unbox Handler results]
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Normally, EVM returns results via the lifted Result type. This is necessary,
since prompt# is not levity-polymorphic, and the wrapping/unwrapping that would
be required if we returned the results in an unlifted type would leak
continuation frames (TODO: write a Note that explains this!).

Normally that is okay, since the optimizer will get rid of almost all of the
intermediate Result values automatically. However, it can’t do that when calling
an effect handler, those are unknown calls. Fortunately, in this situation,
there is no obstacle to doing the unboxing explicitly, as we have control over
the way we store handlers in the targets vector.

The idea is simple enough. In `handle`, we accept an Eff value, but we eagerly
adapt it to return an unboxed value:

    handle (Eff# (EVM# m)) =
      ... case result of { (# s, Result a b #) -> (# s, a, b #) } ...

We arrange for that case expression to appear in a minimal unfolding that can be
aggressively inlined at use sites, as described in Note [Manual worker/wrapper].
At each use site, GHC can see both the wrapping and unwrapping, so it will
eliminate the Result constructor altogether.

Dually, on the other side, we do the inverse transformation in `send`:

    send e = ... case f e rs s of { (# s, a, b #) -> (# s, Result a b #) } ...

In exactly the same fashion, GHC can inline `send` at its use site (since its
definition is very small), and the wrapping will be fused with any local
unwrapping. Voilà, we have eliminated the constructor even across unknown calls!

In reality, this wrapping/unwrapping is handled via the Handler pattern synonym,
just as for all the other types we do this manual transformation for. -}

-- | Lifts an 'Eff' computation into one that performs all the same effects, and
-- possibly more. For example, if you have a computation
--
-- @
-- m :: 'Eff' '[Foo, Bar] ()
-- @
--
-- then 'lift' will transform it into a polymorphic computation with the
-- following type:
--
-- @
-- 'lift' m :: (Foo ':<' effs, Bar ':<' effs) => 'Eff' effs ()
-- @
--
-- This type is much more general, and @effs@ can now be instantiated at many
-- different types. Generally, 'lift' can manipulate the list of effects in any
-- of the following ways:
--
--   * Effects can be reordered.
--   * New effects can be inserted anywhere in the list.
--   * Duplicate effects can be collapsed.
--
-- More generally, the list of effects doesn’t need to be entirely concrete in
-- order for 'lift' to work. For example, if you have a computation
--
-- @
-- n :: 'Eff' (Foo ': Bar ': effs1) ()
-- @
--
-- then @'lift' n@ will have the following type:
--
-- @
-- 'lift' n :: (Foo ':<' effs2, Bar ':<' effs2, effs1 ':<<' effs2) => 'Eff' effs2 ()
-- @
--
-- This type is extremely general, and it allows 'lift' to manipulate the /head/
-- of the effects list even if the entire list is not completely known.
--
-- The 'Lift' typeclass provides some type-level programming machinery to
-- implement 'lift', but it should be treated as an implementation detail. In
-- most situations, the machinery should “just work,” but if it doesn’t, the
-- type errors can be somewhat inscrutable. In those situations, adding some
-- explicit type annotations (or using @TypeApplications@) can improve the type
-- errors significantly.
